# This is done using the first n primes, where m is the number of possible states - 1. 
#   In the use case this script was made for, there are n = 25 cells of m = 3 possible states.
#   This script has been designed with more general use in mind.

# Convert state to number
#   essentially just base conversion (see the blurb above "num_to_state" for more info)
def state_to_num(state = np.zeros((Config.num_cells), dtype = Config.cell_state_dtype), base = Config.num_cell_states, cell_count = Config.num_cells):
    # used to keep track of the number that will be acquired throughout this function
    num = 0

    # there are n cells, so go through for each of them
    for i in range(0, cell_count):
        # if the state of the current cell is 0, continue to the next iteration of the loop (i.e. skip below).
        if not state[i]:
            continue

        # otherwise, add the current power times the cell's state

# The problem of converting num to state is actually much simpler than I was making it; all it really is is converting a base 10
#   number to base <num_cell_states>, where each of the digits in the base <num_cell_states> representation are a cell state.

# TL;DR: This function is essentially just converting the given number (num) to base <num_cell_states> (e.g. base 3 for our purposes)

    # initialize the list to store non-empty cells (and empty cells in between)
    digits = []

    # keep going until num < 1, i.e. until it can only be 0 when cast to int
    while num >= 1:
        # get the next base <num_cell_states> digit to be output
        digits.append(int(num % base))

    # put the new base <num_cell_states> number into an array to represent the board state
